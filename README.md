# Personal Assistant in a Planter

    I have been really wanting to get a personal digital assistant, or whatever they're called, for a while now. I am sort of averse to most of the commercial options, due to proprietary workings under the hood. Looking around, the Mycroft open source project has come a long way.
    The other issue, is that with the current assistants, you're talking to a lump of plastic. I wanted my assistant to really come to life, so I am going to incorporate it in side of a plant. The idea is that with the living plant working with the assistant, I will be more mindful of using the assistant and maintaining the plant. Plus, a little greenery is always a nice idea.

## What do I need?
### I need a plant
    First I need to decide on a plant. It needs to be one that is fairly simple to take care of, but also needs enough care that I am involved in maintaining it. Cactuses are out, as are any illicit substance plants. Right now I am leaning towards a Japanese Peace Lilly, mostly due to the film Hot Fuzz.

### I need to make an enclosure.
    The plant needs to be watered, but I want the entire thing to feel like one object.  So a two layered pot/pi-case needs to be designed and printed.  This means getting upto speed on 3D CAD design.  I have the printer already. Right now, I am thinking of just printing a sort of stand that will go under the pot.

### I need the other materials
    I will also need a raspberry pi, a microphone, a speaker, a hydrometer, and a power supply.

### I need to write some software
    Some coding will need to happen.  Mycroft will need to be given tasks to monitor water.  I also want to come up with a list of necessary tasks for a pesonal assistant that I use.  These will also need to be incorporated.

### I need to hook everything up
    Pretty much just finish it.

## What will it do?
    TBD
## How will it be set up?
    TBD
